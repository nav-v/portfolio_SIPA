                "Singapore has one of the **world's lowest fertility rates**. It competes with East Asian countries like South Korea for the lowest TFR (Total Fertility Rate) every year. To boost birth rates to at least replacement level (TFR = 2.1), the Singapore government has introduced various pro-natalist policies like a direct cash subsidy called the Baby Bonus from the early 2000s. Whilst we might not be able to establish any causality in this short project, it would be interesting to visually see if birth rates have stablised after the introduction of these policies. Before moving to that however, we can start with establishing some summary statistics to understand the problem."
