                "In the first two projects, we looked at Singapore's low fertility rates, and the Singapore Government's response to it. In particular, in 2001, Singapore introduced the **Baby Bonus** scheme to combat declining fertility rates. Mothers were given a cash subsidy of $3,000 if they were having a second child, and $4,000 if they were having a third child. The policy was not extended to 1st children until 2004.\n",
                "\n",
                "Whilst we mentioned the subsidy in Project 1 and looked at birth-rates in Singapore after the introduction of the policy, we were critically not able to ascertain causality. For this project, I'm going to attempt to do so using a method that I've learnt about in my undergrade studies - Difference-in-Difference (DiD).\n",
                "\n",
                "The application of the policy for only first child from 2001-2004 creates a natural experiment of sorts. Assuming that birth trends are related, and that the populations are similar we can derive a treatment and control group:\n",
                "    - **Treatment Group:** 2nd child births (received incentive starting 2001)\n",
                "    - **Control Group:** 1st child births (did NOT receive incentive until 2004)\n",
                "\n",
                "By comparing the change in 2nd births vs 1st births before and after 2001, we can estimate the **causal effect** of the policy.\n",
